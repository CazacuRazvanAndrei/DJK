# **Docker Compose**

This chapter introduces the concept of an application consisting of multiple services, each running in a container, and how Docker Compose allows us to easily build, run, and scale such an application using a declarative approach.

## This chapter covers the following topics:

- [Demystifying declarative versus imperative](demystifying-declarative-versus-imperative.md)
- [Running a multi-service application](running-a-multi-service-application.md)
- [Building and pushing an application](building-and-pushing-an-application.md)
- [Scaling a service](Scaling-a-service.md)
- [Using Docker Compose overrides](Using-Docker-Compose-overrides.md)
